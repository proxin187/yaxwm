# YaxWM

YaxWM is a work-in-progress pure rust, x11 window manager with its own x11 implementation (yaxi).

## Why Choose YaxWM
* Small - YaxWM has a small codebase compared to other similarly featured window managers such as bspwm
* Extensible - YaxWM by itself only responds to X Events and messages over a socket, communication with the socket is done using yaxc in combination with third party software (e.g. sxhkd), this gives more extensible control over the window manager.
* Real Time - YaxWM responds to your configuration changes real time as they happen
